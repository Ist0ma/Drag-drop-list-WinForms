# Drag and Sort WinForms Application
This repository contains a simple Windows Forms application that allows users to create and interactively sort draggable picture boxes. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can create new picture boxes, drag them around the form, and sort them by rearranging their positions.

## Features:
- **Create Picture Boxes**: Users can add new picture boxes by clicking the "Add Picture Box" button. Each picture box is labeled with a unique number inside it.

- **Drag and Sort**: The picture boxes can be dragged around the form freely using the mouse.

- **Interactive Sorting**: Users can interactively sort the picture boxes by dragging them up or down. When a picture box is moved to a new position, the other picture boxes dynamically adjust their positions to make room for the moved box.

- **Visual Feedback**: While dragging a picture box, a highlight box appears at the target position, providing visual feedback for the sorting operation.

## How to Use:
1.  Clone the repository or download the source code.

2.  Open the solution in Visual Studio (or any compatible IDE).

3.  Build the application.

4.  Run the Drag_and_Sort executable to launch the application.

5.  Click the "Add Picture Box" button to create new picture boxes.

6.  Click and hold the left mouse button on a picture box to drag it around the form.

7.  Drag a picture box over other boxes to sort them interactively.

8.  Release the mouse button to place the picture box at the desired position.

## Compatibility:
This Drag and Sort application was developed using C# and Windows Forms (WinForms) and should work on any Windows machine with .NET Framework installed.
